# Twitch-Chat
To run the code you will need to install Python.  
Additionally, you will need to install the following python module using pip:  

python -m pip install keyboard  

Once Python is set up, simply change the Twitch username in TwitchChat_Settings.py, and you'll be ready to go.
Just run the "TwitchChat_Settings.py" file and it should work!
